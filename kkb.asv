function kkb(x, y, F, m, n)
% kkb: calculates C = B^(+) * F * (A^(+))'
% PREAMBLE: ^(+) is simply written as \ in MATLAB (psuedo inverse)
% INPUT: x vector with dim m and y vector with dim n
% VALUES INSIDE: A/B: takes x/y values as column vectors and raises them
% to the power of the column where they are
A = 
kron(A,B)\F(:);
end
